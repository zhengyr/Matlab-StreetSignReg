ABSTRACT
This project investigates street sign-recognition methods in the field of computer vision. The goal is to take in a road- side image and to identify street signs within the image based on known definitions of signs. Shape-based detection using the fast radial symmetry transform is used to identify sym- metrical points of interest in the attempt to segment street signs from input images. Using a database of known signs, template matching was determined to be moderately accurate but inefficient. Color-detection employs known color ranges for street signs and creates a two-dimensional area targeting potential signs. The segmented areas created through these methods are then textually processed using optical character recognition augmented by using maximally stable extremal regions.
